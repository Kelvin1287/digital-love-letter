                <p>Dear Shan,</p>
                <p>It's actually crazy how a couple months
                    ago I never even know you existed. Now, I
                    can't even go a day or two without you.</p>
                <p>Somehow, in just a few months, you've
                    become my favorite person. The one I
                    want to talk to about everything. The one
                    who makes me laugh, and the one who i
                    enjoy spending the most time with. It
                    doesn't matter what I do with you, just
                    being around you is enough to make my
                    day. Days feel like hours and hours feel like
                    minutes when I'm with you.</p>
                <p>I just want you to know that what truly
                    drew me to you wasn't your looks, but just
                    who you are. I just love you for you, you
                    just being yourself. That's what caught my
                    attention. Having a girlfriend like you in
                    this day of age is very rare and I will always
                    cherish that.</p>
                <p>Being with you has made me want to
                    become a better person. Making sure you
                    did not make the wrong choice when you
                    chose me. You inspire me to become
                    better, and I am grateful for that. You came
                    at the very perfect timing where just when I
                    thought I had given up on love, you brought
                    back that feeling.</p>
                <p>I don't know how I got this lucky, but I do
                    know I'm not letting go. I hope we get to go
                    to Taiwan together for university but if I
                    somehow don't get in, I want you to know
                    that I will not leave you, even if we're far
                    apart.</p>
